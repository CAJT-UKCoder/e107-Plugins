This roster system is loosely based upon the milpacs system designed for phpnuke and phpnuke evo. This roster system took over 300 hours 
to get to the state that it is in now.

HOW TO INSTALL

Upload all files within the "roster" folder to your e107_Plugins directory.
Go to your plugin manager and install "Roster by Carl Taylor"
Once installed you may configure the settings by clicking the configure button.

HOW TO USE

You must create a GROUP, otherwise any user that you create will not show up. 
You must create ranks, so that users have a rank attached to their profile.
You must then create the users profile, and although not every area needs to be filled in, it certainly is helpful.
You may then create the awards (if you clan uses them) and have that show up in a seperate area.

You are able to edit all GROUPS, USERS, RANKS, and AWARDS once they have been created.

HOW TO ADD THE SITE LINKS

The Roster link is added by default.
Go to sitelinks and add www.domainnamehere.com/e107_plugins/roster/awards.php to add the awards page to your site links.
Go to sitelinks and add www.domainnamehere.com/e107_plugins/roster/ranks.php to add the ranks page to your site links.

IMAGE FORMAT

All images are set to work from .png format, this is to minimise the space used on your server, and the loading times on the pages.

All "Big" rank images must be placed in the "images\ranks\big" folder with the EXACT acronym that is used, for example PVT will be PVT.png 
"Big" ranks are the ranks which will show up on the Ranks Page, and in the userprofiles.

All "Small" rank images must be placed in the "images\ranks\small" folder with sml and EXACT acronym that is used, for example PVT will 
be smlPVT.png

"Small" ranks are the ranks which will show up on the Roster Page.

All "Big" medal/award images must be placed in the "images\awards\big" folder with the EXACT acronym that is used, for example MOH will 
be MOH.png.

Big medal/awards are the awards/medals which will show up on the Medals Page.

ALL PROFILE PICTURES MUST BE IN .jpg FORMAT OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK! For the Uniform images you MUST type in the NAME of the file (without the .jpg at the end) for the uniform/profile picture so that it shows up, otherwise you will get a missing picture icon. All images must go to the /roster/images/profilepicture folder.
